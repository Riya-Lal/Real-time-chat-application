# Real-time-chat-application
It is a real, time chat application. This application allows multiple users to chat together, also notifies fellow member when somebody joins, messages and leaves the chat with a notification sound too giving a real time experience.
Built it using node.js and socket.io. node.js will handle number of connection in a single server and socket.io enable real time bidirectional communication between the web client and the server.
we have used html, css for frontend and visual studio code as ide and we have created two js directory one for client side and one for server side.
This application can be used by many people simultaneiusly who have joined using the same port number which is created by running the program and thus enjoy the real time experience.
This chat application can also be helpful when we want to do secret chatting as the chat is not saved.
